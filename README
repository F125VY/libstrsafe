libstrsafe is a cross platform implementation of the Safe String Library
(StrSafe.h) provided by Microsoft. The library will allow multi platform
software to use a single library for safe string operations. This will reduce
the risk for buffer overflows and will increase code sharing between code for
different platforms.

For more information on the project, see the Google Summer of Code project
site [1] or the GitHub repository [2].
