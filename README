libstrsafe is a cross platform implementation of the Safe String Library
(StrSafe.h) provided by Microsoft. The library will allow multi platform
software to use a single library for safe string operations. This will reduce
the risk for buffer overflows and will increase code sharing between code for
different platforms.

For documentation of the functions, see the documentation for the Microsoft
implementation [0].

Most of the functionality of the library has been unit tested and the unit
tests have been verified against the Microsoft implementation. For more
information on the testing, see the TESTING file.

Some things haven't been tested and it is possible that the behaviour is
different from the behaviour of the Microsoft implementation in those cases.
These things include but might not be limited to using more than one flag
at the same time to the extended functions as well as sending input to
the Gets functions that encounters EOF without a preceding line break.

For more information on the project, see the Google Summer of Code project
site [1] or the GitHub repository [2].
