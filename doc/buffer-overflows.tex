\section{An introduction to buffer overflow attacks}
\subsection{What is a buffer overflow?}
Strings in programs are usually stored in a buffer as a series of characters,
ending with a \emph{null} character to signify the end of the string.
In low level systems such as when programming in C,
there is usually no separate information on the length of the string.

When a string is copied into another string buffer,
the characters are simply copied until the null character is located.
If this string won't fit in the memory area allocated at the destination,
the adjacent memory area might be overwritten.
This is known as a buffer overflow or buffer overrun.

\subsection{How are buffer overflow attacks used?}
Buffer overflows are among the most usual sources of
security related bugs in software and
there are many well known examples of this.

Some examples of the use of buffer overflows include the

and Blaster\footnote{\url{http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-20.html}}
worms as well as jailbreaks
for the Apple iPhone\footnote{\url{http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4291}}
and Nintendo Wii.\footnote{\url{http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Twilight_Hack}}
