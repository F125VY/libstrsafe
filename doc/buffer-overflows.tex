\section{An introduction to buffer overflow attacks}
\subsection{What is a buffer overflow?}
Strings in programs are usually stored in a buffer as a series of characters,
ending with a \emph{null} character to signify the end of the string.
In low level systems such as when programming in C,
there is usually no separate information on the length of the string.

When a string is copied into another string buffer,
the characters are simply copied until the null character is located.
If this string won't fit in the memory area allocated at the destination,
the adjacent memory area might be overwritten.
This is known as a buffer overflow or buffer overrun.

A buffer overflow can be used to overwrite data used in the program,
but it can also be used to overwrite control data in the stack or heap
that stores the buffer.
This can enable the attacker to run arbritrary code on the system.

For example, by overwriting the return address of the current stack frame,
the overflow can enable the attacker to use any available data as code.
If the attacker fills a buffer with carefully chosen machine code,
known as shellcode,
and modifies the return address of the current stack frame
to jump to the buffer,
the chosen machine code will be run by the program.

By instead exploiting a buffer overflow on the heap,
the control structures for dynamic memory allocation are often overwritten.
By modifying the linked list used to keep track of
the dynamically allocated memory in many \emph{malloc} implementations,
function pointers can later be overwritten to enable
execution of arbritrary code.

\subsection{How are buffer overflow attacks used?}
Buffer overflows are among the most usual sources of
security related bugs in software and
there are many well known examples of this.

Some examples of the use of buffer overflows include the

and Blaster\footnote{\url{http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-20.html}}
worms as well as jailbreaks
for the Apple iPhone\footnote{\url{http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4291}}
and Nintendo Wii.\footnote{\url{http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Twilight_Hack}}

\subsection{Protecting against buffer overflow attacks}
There are several ways to protect software against buffer overflow attacks,
by modifying either the source code or
the execution environment that the software runs in.

By using safe coding practices, many buffer overflow bugs can be avoided.
If all buffer capacities and data lengths are checked,
the risk for a buffer overflow is greatly reduced.
However, programmers still make mistakes,
so additional precautions are often required.

By checking the capacites of all involved buffers,
