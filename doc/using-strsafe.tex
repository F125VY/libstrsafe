\section{Using \emph{libstrsafe}}
The functions in \emph{libstrsafe} are meant as replacement for
the string copying functions available in the standard C libraries.
In contrast to the standard functions,
the functions always require the maximum capacity of any buffer
that the funciton will write data into
and will guarantee both
that the string will be null terminated before the end of the buffer
and that no data will be written outside of the buffer.

To simplify use of the library,
all functions share a common system of return codes.
All functions return a status code signifying the result of the call.
These status codes can be used to check whether the call was successful
or check the specific error condition if it was not.
