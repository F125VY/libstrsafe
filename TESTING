The functionality of libstrsafe is tested with unit tests. The tests are
located in the tests/ subdirectory and are using the C TAP Harness by Russ
Allbery [0]. It is a harness for the Test Anything Protocol that provides
unit testing in C and shell scripts.

For almost all functions, a test is provided to check that it functions
properly. These are primarily written in C, but the tests for the Gets
functions are written in a shell script instead since the Gets functions
reads inuput from stdin.

For tests to be run in the test harness, the executable files have to end in
"-t". For C files that means that source code for the tests are available at
tests/<function name>-t.c while the shell script tests are available at
tests/<function name>-t.

The tests are run by running "make check" from the project root directory.
To get additional information from a single test, run
"tests/runtests -o <test name>" from the 

The tests that are to be run are listed in the tests/TESTS file and also
have to be listed in the check_PROGRAMS target in tests/Makefile.am.
